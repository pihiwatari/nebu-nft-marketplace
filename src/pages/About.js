          Inspired by Japanese Pop Culture and outer-space themed, NEBU was
          originaly a commercial project for soda-like ice cream products
          looking to set itself apart from most ice cream shops.
          It was actually built as an ice cream shop, operating for around
          6 months.

          Since we had all the graphic design files and elements created, we
          decided to create the 'Nebuniverse'.
          The Nebuniverse collection is an NFT collectibles project, to share
          some of the love we have for this project. We are looking for ways
          to leverage the power of blockchain in favor of intellectual
          property for the Industrial / Interior / Brand Design.
