# This is a work in progress

We are trying to create a NFT collection about a project we developed a few years ago.
It was about canned ice cream, which we hoped to sell in Japan, from where this project is based.

## An e-commerce project

Or at least to have e-commerce functionality and maybe some NFT game project. As for the aesthetics, we are looking to emulate Maplestory a 2D MMO videogame from early 2010s.
